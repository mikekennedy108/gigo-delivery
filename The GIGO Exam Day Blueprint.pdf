The GIGO Exam Day Blueprint
Exam day is not just about knowledge — it’s about execution. What you do before and during the test determines whether your preparation pays off. This blueprint gives you a step‑by‑step plan to follow so you walk in calm, focused, and ready to pass.


Step 1 — The Night Before
- Pack everything: ID, admission ticket, directions, water, snacks.
- Lay out comfortable clothes (dress in layers).
- Set two alarms.
- Stop cramming — trust your system. Review only your confidence notes.
- Go to bed early. Aim for 7–8 hours of sleep.


Step 2 — Morning Routine
- Wake up early so you’re not rushed.
- Eat a balanced meal (protein + complex carbs; avoid heavy sugar).
- Hydrate well, but not excessively.
- Do 5 minutes of deep breathing and visualization.
- Read your sticky note reminder: “I’ve done it before. I’ll do it again.”


Step 3 — Arrival
- Arrive at least 30 minutes early.
- Use travel time to rehearse calm breathing.
- Avoid negative talk with other test‑takers.
- Keep earbuds with calming music if needed.


Step 4 — Pre‑Test Reset
- Once seated, close your eyes for 60 seconds.
- Inhale 4 seconds, hold 2, exhale 6. Repeat x3.
- Visualize yourself completing the exam confidently.
- Say quietly: “I’m ready. Let’s do this.”


Step 5 — During the Test
- Read every question carefully.
- Mark the obvious correct answers first.
- If stuck, move on — don’t burn time.
- Use the full time. If you finish early, recheck flagged questions.
- Keep breathing steady to avoid panic.


Step 6 — Mental Anchors
- If anxiety spikes, pause and touch the desk or chair to ground yourself.
- Whisper in your mind: “Calm. Focus. Win.”
- Remember: one tough question doesn’t define the outcome.


Step 7 — After the Exam
- Walk out proud for showing up prepared.
- Do not obsessively replay questions.
- Reward yourself with a small celebration — you’ve earned it.
- Shift your focus forward: success is now in motion.


Final Word
The exam is simply your opportunity to demonstrate the preparation you’ve already done. Follow this blueprint and you’ll walk in steady, walk out strong, and leave doubt at the door.  These extra steps are mainly for those who are preconditioned for very high anxiety.  You will most likely be fine with GIGO alone.  Remember that GIGO is scientifically proven.  Remember the Red Nissans.  It works, so get in there and crush it!
